🧠 Project Overview
This project combines:
•	A traditional Machine Learning classifier for accurate spam detection
•	A Large Language Model (LLM) to provide human-friendly explanations and advice
Why this approach?
•	ML models are fast and reliable for classification
•	LLMs make predictions explainable and user-friendly

🧪 Spam Classification Model
📌 Model Used
Multinomial Naive Bayes
This model is trained on processed SMS/Email text using TF-IDF vectorization, making it highly effective for text classification tasks.
📊 Model Performance
Metric	Score
Accuracy	0.9822
Precision	0.99
Recall	0.8534
F1-Score	0.9167
✔ High precision ensures very few false spam alerts
✔ Strong recall ensures most spam messages are caught

🤖 Large Language Model (LLM) for Explanation
📌 Model Used
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instant
The LLM is used after classification to:
•	Explain why a message is spam or not
•	Identify the type of spam (phishing, promotion, scam, etc.)
•	Provide one practical safety suggestion
🧠 Why LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instant?
•	Excellent reasoning and instruction following
•	Fast inference for real-time APIs
•	Generates clear, concise, and contextual explanations
•	Ideal for Explainable AI (XAI) use cases

🔄 System Workflow
1.	User enters a message
2.	Text is preprocessed (tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming)
3.	Multinomial Naive Bayes predicts → Spam / Not Spam
4.	Prediction + message are sent to LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instant
5.	User receives:
o	Classification result
o	Explanation
o	One safety recommendation
